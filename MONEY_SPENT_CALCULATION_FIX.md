# Money Spent Calculation Fix

## üéØ **Issue Fixed**

The client information was not correctly calculating the money spent for each client. The `total_spent` field in the customers table was never being updated when bookings were completed or invoices were paid.

## üîß **Root Cause**

The system had a `total_spent` field in the customers table, but it was never being updated because:

1. **Booking completion** - When a booking status changed to 'completed', the total_spent wasn't updated
2. **Invoice payments** - When an invoice payment_status changed to 'paid', the total_spent wasn't updated
3. **No automatic calculation** - There was no function to calculate and update the total_spent based on actual transactions

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Money Calculation Function**

Created `updateCustomerTotalSpent()` function in `server.js` that:

- **Calculates from completed bookings**: Counts completed bookings √ó default service cost ($150)
- **Calculates from paid invoices**: Sums all paid invoice amounts
- **Updates customer record**: Updates `total_spent` and `total_bookings` fields
- **Logs changes**: Provides console logging for tracking

```javascript
function updateCustomerTotalSpent(customerId, callback) {
    // Calculate total from completed bookings
    const bookingsQuery = `
        SELECT COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
               COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_bookings
        FROM bookings 
        WHERE customer_id = ?
    `;
    
    // Calculate total from paid invoices
    const invoicesQuery = `
        SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as total_paid
        FROM invoices 
        WHERE customer_id = ? AND payment_status = 'paid'
    `;
    
    // Update customer record with calculated totals
    const updateQuery = `
        UPDATE customers 
        SET total_spent = ?, 
            total_bookings = ?,
            updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        WHERE customer_id = ?
    `;
}
```

### **2. Updated Booking Status Endpoint**

Modified `/api/bookings/:bookingId/status` to automatically update total_spent when a booking is completed:

```javascript
// If booking is completed, update customer total spent
if (status === 'completed' && booking.customer_id) {
    updateCustomerTotalSpent(booking.customer_id, (err, totalSpent) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error updating customer total spent:', err);
        }
    });
}
```

### **3. Updated Invoice Payment Endpoint**

Modified `/api/invoices/:invoiceId/payment` to automatically update total_spent when an invoice is paid:

```javascript
// If invoice is paid, update customer total spent
if (payment_status === 'paid' && invoice.customer_id) {
    updateCustomerTotalSpent(invoice.customer_id, (err, totalSpent) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error updating customer total spent:', err);
        }
    });
}
```

### **4. Added Recalculation Endpoint**

Created `/api/customers/recalculate-totals` endpoint to manually recalculate all customer totals:

```javascript
app.post('/api/customers/recalculate-totals', (req, res) => {
    // Recalculates total_spent for all customers
    // Useful for fixing existing data
});
```

### **5. Updated Admin Panel Display**

Enhanced the admin panel to show correct money spent information:

- **Customer Details**: Shows total_spent and total_bookings
- **Customer Cards**: Displays accurate total_spent from database
- **Recalculate Button**: Added button to manually recalculate all totals

### **6. Added Test Script**

Created `test-money-calculation.js` to verify the functionality:

```bash
node test-money-calculation.js
```

## üìä **How Money Spent is Calculated**

### **Formula:**
```
Total Spent = (Completed Bookings √ó $150) + (Sum of Paid Invoices)
```

### **Components:**

1. **Completed Bookings**: Each completed booking adds $150 (default service cost)
2. **Paid Invoices**: Each paid invoice adds its total_amount to the total
3. **Real-time Updates**: Totals update automatically when statuses change

## üöÄ **Usage Instructions**

### **Automatic Updates:**
- When you mark a booking as "completed" ‚Üí total_spent updates automatically
- When you mark an invoice as "paid" ‚Üí total_spent updates automatically

### **Manual Recalculation:**
1. Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Customer Management
2. Click "Recalculate Totals" button
3. Confirm the action
4. Wait for completion message

### **Viewing Results:**
- **Customer Cards**: Show total_spent in the stats section
- **Customer Details**: Show detailed breakdown in customer info
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/customers` returns updated totals

## üîç **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Run the Test Script:**
```bash
node test-money-calculation.js
```

### **2. Manual Testing:**
1. Create a test booking
2. Mark it as "completed"
3. Check customer total_spent is updated
4. Create a test invoice
5. Mark it as "paid"
6. Check customer total_spent is updated again

### **3. Admin Panel Testing:**
1. Go to Customer Management
2. Click "Recalculate Totals"
3. Verify totals are updated
4. Check customer details show correct amounts

## üìù **Database Schema**

The customers table now properly uses these fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    customer_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    total_bookings INTEGER DEFAULT 0,    -- Updated automatically
    total_spent REAL DEFAULT 0,          -- Updated automatically
    first_booking_date TEXT,
    last_booking_date TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üéâ **Benefits**

1. **Accurate Financial Tracking**: Real-time calculation of customer spending
2. **Automatic Updates**: No manual intervention required
3. **Historical Data**: Proper tracking of all completed transactions
4. **Admin Tools**: Easy recalculation and verification tools
5. **Consistent Display**: Accurate information across all admin panels

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

1. **Service-Specific Pricing**: Store actual service prices in bookings table
2. **Payment Tracking**: Track partial payments and payment history
3. **Financial Reports**: Generate spending reports and analytics
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Categorize customers by spending levels
